# Salvatore
Welcome to my profile. I'm Salvatore, 18 years old (🇬🇧) and currently researching Windows Kernel Security. I'm interested in programming, graphic designing, game hacking/exploiting. My root language is C++ or Web (Full stack) but I'm also proficient enought in Lua, Python, Assembler and Reverse Engineering.
